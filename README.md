# ErdosQuantum_FirstProject
Miniproject 1 from Erdos Quantum Computing Boot Camp, Summer 2025.
This project is still in progress. The partial notebook has been added to the repo.

## Sudoku Solver
We use Qiskit to build a quantum circuit that returns the solution to a 4x4 sudoku puzzle. This solution is presented as the jupyter notebook, Sudoku_Solver.ipnyb and includes tested examples. Necessary packages include numpy and qiskit.

## Multi-controlled U gate and other upcoming stories
I intend to continue to solve some of the other problems posed in this homework set. Each solution will be included in this repository as a separate notebook.
